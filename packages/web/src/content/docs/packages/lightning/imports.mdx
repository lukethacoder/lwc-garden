import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

## Configuration

Add the `@lwc-garden/utils` package to the `modules` config in your `lwr.config.json` file:

```json
// lwr.config.json
{
  "lwc": {
    "modules": [
      {
        "npm": "@lwc-garden/utils"
      }
    ]
  },
}
```


## Supported Imports

The below is a list of currently supported `lightning/*` based imports that can run locally. This is not an extensive list and only includes utilities, not components. `lightning-*` components may be found [here](/packages/lightning/components).

<Aside>
Some of the imports have further information that can be found further down the page

### lightning/platformResourceLoader

Both `loadStyle` and `loadScript` will function slightly differently based on if the synthetic shadow is being used or if the native shadow is used.

Native shadow will import resources within the context of the caller (the `LightningElement` the `loadStyle` or `loadScript` method was called from). This will mean any CSS/JS imported will be scoped to that specific component.

```html
<!-- lwc/myComponent/myComponent.html -->
<c-my-component>
  #shadow-root
  <p>My Component</p>
  <style type="text/css">@import url('/force-app/main/default/staticresources/testResource/style.css');</style>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="/force-app/main/default/staticresources/testResource/script.js" async></script>
</c-my-component>
```

Synthetic shadow will import resources globally, in the `document.head`, and allow all CSS/JS imports to be accessible by other components. This is currently the default for on-platform Salesforce development.

```html
<head>
  <style type="text/css">@import url('/force-app/main/default/staticresources/testResource/style.css');</style>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="/force-app/main/default/staticresources/testResource/script.js" async></script>
</head>
```
