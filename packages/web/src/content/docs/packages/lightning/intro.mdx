description: LWC Garden mocks for lightning/* based imports

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'


The `@lwc-garden/utils` package provides a few handy mocks for `lightning/*` imports. In addition to the mocks, we also provide a subset of `lightning-*` components to be able to run `lightning-*` components locally without relying on the deprecated [`lightning-base-components`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lightning-base-components) package.

<Aside type="caution">
Not all imports have been mocked. Feel free to open a [Pull Request](https://github.com/lukethacoder/lwc-garden) to add functionality if required.
